## Description
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that parses Zoom's self-generated audio transcripts, and outputs a .txt and .docx file of the transcript which combines each speaker's adjacent spoken words. By default, Zoom breaks each person's speech up every set amount of time. This results in pages of transcript for a few sentences of actual transcribed text. This notebook file searches for all .txt files in a given directory, and combines adjacent transcribed speech from the same speaker.
